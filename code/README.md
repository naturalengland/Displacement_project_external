#Code used within the displacement project

A more detailed R script on the Socio-economic and environmental analyses used for a hypothetical area of closure. Aims include:

- Plot heatmaps of the catch-weight, value, time spent fishing and effot (kWh) for the area of closure and surrounding areas.
- Plot barcharts of the catch-weight, value, time spent fishing and effot (kWh) for the area of closure, depending on gear type and vessel size.
- Calculate swept area ratio based on gear type and swept sensitivity ratio, depending on habitat type for the environmental analysis. Plotting heatmaps based on the results.
- Link VMS/IVMS data to environmental data including the blue carbon habitat map, essential fish habitat map, the Natural England Marine Evidence Base Broadscale Habitat Map and the Natural England Spatial Seabed Sensitivity Tool. In order to identify sensitive areas where fishing activity may be occurring.
- Predict where fishing vessels may be displaced to with respect to the closure, indentifying areas where fishing actvity/effort may increase.

Each of these steps are clearly outlined within the R script: Socio-economic analysis for paper.R
